Note: All code included in this repository outside of "AiModExample.cpp" was written by Arthur Danskin and Chris Barrett of Anisoptera Games.


AiModExample.cpp is my attempt at improving Reassembly's tournament AI to make ships behave in a more intelligent manner; most of the file's original content has been replaced with my experimental changes and new behaviours.

This project was placed on hold due to header changes which I did not have access to, but as these have been publicized recently, I may continue work on this.
